## Description

After watching and coding along with several tutorials online I wanted to test my overall knowledge and implementation of React and CSS so I decided I would build my favorite website from scratch. This felt like such an undertaking to begin-- but once I began I found so much joy in adding new features, and completely making this website MINE.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Install NPM packages

- npm

```sh
npm install
```

- yarn

```sh
yarn install
```

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

Deployed site: https://akc-imdb.netlify.app/

IMDb Clone built from scratch.

Fully functional Navigation bar.

Each button takes you to a new page, some buttons even have hover capabilities.

Called an API for the IMDbTV page -- each movie poster is clickable which reveals a trailer from youtube.

The play buttons on the home screen are fully functional and bring up a trailer which is unique to the button pressed.

The main movie can change with a horizontal scroll.

The coming soon to theatres section are short films that have been directed by me.

The Trending celebrities can update with a horizontal scroll.

The website is fully responsive, and the information in Featured Today, Fan Favorites, Exclusive Videos, Explore what is streaming, On TV, Trending Celebrities, and Top News is all available with a horizontal scroll.
