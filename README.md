## Description

After watching and coding along with several tutorials online I wanted to test my overall knowledge and implementation of React and CSS so I decided I would build my favorite website from scratch. This felt like such an undertaking to begin-- but once I began I found so much joy in adding new features, and completely making this website MINE.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Install NPM packages

- npm

```sh
npm install
```

- yarn

```sh
yarn install
```

## Roadmap/Features

- [ ] Fully functional navigation bar.
  - [ ] Each button takes you to a new page, some buttons even have hover capabilities.
- [ ] The play buttons on the home screen next to movie posters will open up a trailer which is unique to the button pressed.
- [ ] The "Coming Soon to Theatres" section are all short films that I have directed/edited.
- [ ] On the IMDbTV page I used the TMDB API to retrieve movie poster data based on different genres.
  - [ ] Each movie poster is made clickable to open a movie trailer from YouTube.
- [ ] Responsive website allows information to be hidden and revealed with a horizontal scroll.
  - [ ] Featured Today, Fan Favorites, Exclusive Videos, Explore, On TV, Trending Celebrities, and Top News all have the horizontal scroll functionality!
